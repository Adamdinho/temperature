1. Fork the github repository 

      > <https://github.com/mcgill-ecse321/temperature>


2. Complete the skeleton file `TemperatureTest.java` to unit test the
   `Temperature` class. You must test the following:

     1. Check the `getUnits()` and `getValue()` functions.

     2. Check the `changeUnits()` function for all six possible
        conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

     Explain your reasoning for choosing the particular test data. Note
     that you may have to choose multiple test data for each of the above
     test cases. 

3. While running the above test cases, if you find bugs in the
   `Temeprature` class, you are allowed to modify the `Temperature`
   class appropriately. 

4. Tag your final code with tag `assignment-2` and **submit the Git URL** of
   your repository. Your rationale for choosing the test data should be described
   in the code comments.
